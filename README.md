# meanjs-themes
Mean.js boilerplate (v 0.3.3) extended with bootswatch themes to decorate the navbar and other components of the application.

Themes module on the top menu is made public to everyone.

It uses the browser's local storage, so every user can select his own theme.

To see it in action just `git clone` this repository and run `grunt` on the top directory. The demo will be running on `localhost:3000`
