# Meanjs-templates

Mean.js boilerplate (v 0.3.3) extended with bootswatch themes to decorate the navbar and other components of the application.

The themes module is made public on the topbar menu so everyone can access it.
It uses the browser's local storage, so every user can select his own theme.

To see it in action:

1. `git clone` this repo

2. Install the dependencies with `npm install` and `bower install` 

3. Run `grunt` on the top level directory

The demo will be running in `localhost:3000`
